	route_id
	dow
	direction_id
		"Direction"
		This is a field to differentiate between routes serving two directions when the destinations aren't shown. It's somewhat ambiguous but is loosely described by Google as simply one of two directions.
		
	route_type
		"Mode"
        The classification system used with this data identifies mode categories. 0 = streetcars, light rail on other on-street rail vehicles. 1 = subways and metros. 2 = commuter or intercity rail. 3 = bus. 4 = ferries. 5 = cable car. 6 = gondola. 7 = funicular. 
		
	average_speed
		"Route Speed"
		This is the scheduled speed that the route is served using the length and times for all trip throughout the day.
		
	average_length_mi
		"Route Length"
		This is the length of the route in miles. Changes in service throughout the day make for slightly different routing, such as certain trips that go a longer distance; this is calculated on the most common configuration of the route.
		
	trips_each_dir
		"Trips per Day"
		For each direction of this route, this is the total number of trips throughout a day.
		
	route_avg_hdwy
		"Route Headway"
		Each headway in the system is calculated as the time between arrivals for a specific route at a specific stop. The route headway is calculated as the average of all headways sharing that route. 
		
	route_stdev_hdwy
		"Headway Variability (Standard Deviation)"
		The standard deviation of the headway calculated in the previous average is an indication of how much variability there is in headways throughout the course of a day. A low standard deviation indicates consistent headways all day while a higher standard deviation indicates variability, such as frequent peak commuter service with infrequent mid-day service.
		
	trip_headsign
		"Destination"
		This is what the agency describes as the direction or destination of this route.

	hours_of_service
		"Hours of Service"
		This is the number of hours where this route provides at least 60-minute headway service. In some cases, this will be less than the span of service, for example when a commuter service runs only in the AM and PM peak hours.
		
	service_span
		"Span of Service"
		This is the number of hours between the first departure and the last arrival of a route. Given the length of the route and the possibility that trips start and end after midnight, this may be more than 24 hours. 
		
	avg_stop_dist_space_ft
		"Average stop spacing"
		(This should be converted to miles)
		The average distance between stops on this route.  Changes in service throughout the day make for slightly different routing, such as certain trips that go a longer distance; this is calculated on the most common configuration of the route.
	
	route_short_name
		"Route Number"
		The number or abbreviation of this route as described by the agency.
		
	route_long_name
		"Route Name"
		The name of the route as described by the agency.

	average_speed
		"Speed on Route"
		
		
	min_arrive_sec

		This is the time the first trip of the day provides service at this stop for this route. This excludes trips that are logically beginning late from the previous evening.
	
	max_dep_sec
	max_dep_time
		"Last Departure"
		This is the time the last trip of the day provides service at this stop for this route. It may be after midnight.
