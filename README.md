Project Funicular

Project Funicular is a web-app in development by James Wong and Andrew Desautels that intends to connect open-source GTFS data to a back-end that will return GIS shapefiles with content derived from those input files. The user will click on a list of publicly available GTFS feeds (current and historic). Funicular will return a shapefile of stops and routes that include information directly from the GTFS feeds (such as route name or stop id), along with calculated metrics stemming from James’ thesis work and published papers (such as average headways, stop density, TCQSM services). The web-app will eventually return non-geographic datasets generated in the process for the stop, stop-route and route designations as described in James’s TRB paper, “Leveraging the General Transit Feed Specification for Efficient Transit Analysis.”
